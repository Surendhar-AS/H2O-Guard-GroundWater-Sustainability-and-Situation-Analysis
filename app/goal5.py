            "Benefits": "Recommended when the extraction-recharge ratio is relatively low, suggesting moderate groundwater availability compared to irrigation demand.",

            "Benefits": "Suitable for regions with moderate extraction-recharge ratios, indicating sufficient groundwater availability for irrigation purposes.",

            "Benefits": "Recommended in areas with higher extraction-recharge ratios, where groundwater availability is relatively high compared to irrigation requirements.",

            "Benefits": "Appropriate for regions with higher extraction-recharge ratios, indicating abundant groundwater resources relative to irrigation demands.",

            "Benefits": "Recommended when the extraction-recharge ratio is very high, suggesting ample groundwater availability compared to irrigation needs.",

        },
        "Flood Irrigation": {
            "Benefits": "Used when groundwater availability is extremely high relative to irrigation demands, as indicated by a very high extraction-recharge ratio.",
            "Advantages": "Involves flooding the entire field with water, often used in rice paddies or forage crops, but can result in water wastage if not managed properly."
